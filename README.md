# Second Assignment for Research Track II - Jupyter Notebook interface for ROS Robot Control and Monitoring

This repository contains ROS (Robot Operating System) nodes and services for controlling and monitoring a robot's movements through a Jupyter Notebook interface.
The Interface allows users to set targets for the robot, cancel ongoing targets, and visualize the robot's current position, goals, and the number of reached and unreached goals through real-time plots.
